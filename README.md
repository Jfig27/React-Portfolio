# React Portfolio

## Description

This is a place to share my projects while applying for jobs and to share my work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

This is a portfolio using React and SASS!

## User Story

```md
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```
